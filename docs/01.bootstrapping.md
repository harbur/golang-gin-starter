# Chapter 1: Bootstrapping

For dependency management we use `dep`.

## Development Requirements

Before starting developing we'll need the following tools to be installed locally:

* [Golang]
* [dep]

    ```sh
    brew install golang dep
    ```

[Golang]: https://golang.org/
[dep]: https://github.com/golang/dep

## Bootstrap Project

We'll build the project with the following components:

* [sirupsen/logrus]: Structured, pluggable logging for Go.
* [gorilla/mux]: A powerful URL router and dispatcher for Go.

[sirupsen/logrus]: https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus
[gorilla/mux]: https://github.com/gorilla/mux

Write the `main.go` as:

```sh
package main

import (
	"net/http"

	log "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"

	"github.com/gorilla/mux"
	"github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promhttp"
)

func main() {
	log.SetLevel(log.DebugLevel)
	log.Info("starting server")

	r := mux.NewRouter()
	r.Handle("/metrics", promhttp.Handler())
	r.HandleFunc("/{rest:.*}", handlerOK).Methods("GET")

	// Listen and Serve
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", r))
}

func handlerOK(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	w.Write([]byte(r.URL.Path))
}
```

## Prepare Dependencies

Before compiling we need to download the dependencies that are referrenced in the code. We vendor our dependencies so that the repository is self-contained and can be compiled without downloading from external repositories.

To do that we use `dep`:

```sh
dep init
```

## Run Code

To run the code we can use `go run` directly:

```sh
# Run the code
go run main.go
# Test connection to port :8080 (on separate terminal)
http :8080
```

## Build Code

Now that we have run the code build the binary:

```sh
go build .
```

And then run the app:

```sh
# Run the App
./golang-demo
# Test connection to port :8080 (on separate terminal)
http :8080
```

> Remember to delete the binary once tested so that you don't commit it on Git repository.

## Build Container Image

Now that the app is ready, let's package it inside a container image.

Prepare a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.11.5-alpine
RUN apk add --no-cache g++
COPY . /go/src/app
WORKDIR /go/src/app
RUN go test ./... && go build .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["/go/src/app/app"]
```

And a `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  golang-demo:
    build: .
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

Now build an image, run it and test it works ok:

```sh
# Build and Run container
docker-compose up
# Test connection to port :8080 (on separate terminal)
http :8080
```

## Build Helm Chart

We have the docker image, in order to be able to deploy it we're still missing the Helm Chart.

```sh
mkdir -p charts/
helm create charts/java-spring-demo
```

Some tweeks we need to do before deploying:

* `templates/deployment.yaml`: containerPort is `8080`
* `values.yaml`:
  * `image.repository`: Update the image repository
  * `image.pullPolicy`: Set to Always
  * `service.type`: NodePort
  * `ingress.*`: Configure Ingress
