# Chapter 0: Getting Started

Before dipping into the implementation let's set the basics of the design process. We'll start building the solution in a way there is value to the solution at the end of each chapter. This goes aligned with [Agile Software Development]'s Sprints. We'll introduce concepts incrementally and build on-top of previous designs. We'll focus on reusability, but try to keep away from too-early engineering for code-reuse. Lastly there multiple valid paths to build a REST API, on those cases we'll discuss alternatives, choose one and be consistent along the project.
