# Golang Starter

This repository is a demo of building a REST API with [Golang] and [SwaggerUI].

We'll be building an API to manage the library of a **Movie streaming service**.

[SwaggerUI]: https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/

## Dependencies

These are the important pieces we use:

* [go mod] for dependency management
* [govvv] for version info
